        <p class="lead">Welcome to my HTML/CSS/Bootstrap portfolio assigned by MITxPro Emeritus 8 month part-time Full Stack Bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm looking forward to gaining knowledge and being taught the skills necessary to create projects on my own without so much starter code. The program is quite ambiguous, jumbled, and so far has not actually taught any of the skills used in the 3 projects they've asked me to include on the project page. While I have indeed built this portfolio from scratch, I did not code the projects themselves, as they were all each around 99% starter code. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I hope this program does better in the future, because supplying a solution file for every assignment is not teaching, especially when no further explanations nor resources are given. The solution files are only ensuring that it <i>looks like</i> students are comprehending the course load and accomplishing a passing grade.
          <br>
          <br>
