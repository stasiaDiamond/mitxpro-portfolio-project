## My Experience

Each assignment listed under projects was almost all starter code that I did not code, but they want us to showcase them in this portfolio.

PacMan Assignment: 95% starter code provided by the curriculum, but I created my own PacPal in Canva.

Eye Movement Assignment: 99% starter code provided by the curriculum, we only needed to copypasta the second eye within the html file and js file.

Bus Tracker Assignment: 99% starter code provided by the curriculum, we just had to copy what was shown in a video. Although they did tell us to change some styles around so I zoomed out, changed the button, and changed the timer intervals.
