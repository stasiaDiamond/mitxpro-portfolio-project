# MITxPro Portfolio of Starter Code Projects

## Assignments

Each assignment listed under projects was almost all starter code that I did not code, but they want us to showcase them in this portfolio.

PacMan Assignment: 95% starter code provided by the curriculum, but I created my own PacPal in Canva.

Eye Movement Assignment: 99% starter code provided by the curriculum, we only needed to copypasta the second eye within the html file and js file.

Bus Tracker Assignment: 99% starter code provided by the curriculum, we just had to copy what was shown in a video. Although they did tell us to change some styles around so I zoomed out, changed the button, and changed the timer intervals.

## Future Dev

Maybe one day I'll go back and change the starter code to actually fully understand what each part of the code is doing, not just the few lines they have us change.

## Resources for Portfolio

Shoutout to ChatGPT, w3schools, geeksforgeeks, and Bootstrap.
